The code starts as a propmt will great the user, asking them to hit the button to start the random generation of a password via the application.
The user, after hitting the "generate password" button, will be given a series of prompts asking for certain criterias to the password; Things like length of password, numbers, letters, and symbols will be asked to be incorperated into the password created. Thus the static variables in the picture, these are all things that can be pushed into the final result for said password.

The same in the above picture, was disscused last paragraph. These are the prompted questions that will be asked as the user circles through them. However, if they choose none of the options, a loop will set asking them to pick at least one of the available fields.

This final section essentially just computes and verifies which fields where accepted as criteria to the final password; Then afterword, generates and returns the final randomized password to the user. 


-This one was hard for me; It took a lot of time to get it running, even despite having some starter code. I had watched quite a lot of videos to assist with this, 
and am not as comfortable with JS and HTML and CSS currently. Though, I'm hoping with a good lot of practice, and with the up coming assignments; I can reduce the time
needed to create a simple application, and become a little more fluent with it.
